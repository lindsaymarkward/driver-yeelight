Ninja Sphere driver (Go) for controlling Yeelight Sunflower bulbs 
(http://www.yeelight.com/en_US/product/yeelight-sunflower)

Finds Yeelight hub using SSDP

Identifies all lights and makes them available as things for the Ninja Sphere to control:

  - on/off state (brightness 100/0)
  - colour
  - brightness
  
Use the configuration (in labs) to rename lights as well as to control them (on/off) directly.
